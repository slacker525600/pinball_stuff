Food truck game, 
Spinner shot to line up customers, 
Each shot either creates a combo or finishes an order, 
Shots for sandwich, drink, fries, vegan option, and toppings for any of those, 
sandwich + toppings, salad + toppings, fries plus toppings, interesting combinations,
 goal is to maximize order values, 
some method to close up for the day or relocate, 
some way for customer feedback to impact scores or maybe number of spins to get a new customer, 
Mutliball for lunchtime rush 
Mini wizard for catered party 
Final wizard mode, parked at pub/bar 

Thoughts, need to unlock toppings for things, 
Unlocking more expensive base menu items, 
If you close up shop without making money do you go out of business and need to fundraise, 
Prep mode vs serving mode, 

Video mode, plating meals, based one meals youâ€™ve served item pops up on left flippers to mode it to a slot middle button to drop it/pick it up,
