I've been spitballing a school themed game, 
4-6 main shots with some kind of a toggle for: 
academics (math,science,english,history,language) 
/sports (track, soccer, basketball, tennis, swimming )
/arts (paint, photography, chorus, orhcestra, theater)
/clubs 


Mini Wizard modes are AP exams for classes, nationals/states? For sports, exhibition for arts, something for clubs making the news? 
Wizard mode IVY League
George a romero pin 
Each shot is a location/film 
If you start that mode, each shot becomes a character from that movie/location,
